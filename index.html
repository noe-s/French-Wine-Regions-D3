        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe statewide distribution of people from New York City incarcerated in the federal prison system reveals the arbitrary nature of the facility where people are assigned to. Of over 50,000 inmates under custody in 2015, 45.0% were indicted in NYC (DOCCS 2016). Since most people in the system are from urban areas and large prison facilities are located in rural areas, incarcerated people are often by necessity located hours from their support networks. This is detrimental to success upon release. The lack of patterns in the spatial distribution of people from NYC throughout the states reveals negligence in the allocation process, providing further support to criminal justice reform that seeks an alternative to prisons.</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe accompanying visualization is sized by the number of inmates from NYC in counties with facilities and colored by region. The "Split by Violent Crime" button moves counties where the majority of the facilties' population were convicted of violent crimes to the top. The crime committed is based off of the most serious crime in each individual’s sentence. Individual records of inmates under custody were retrieved from the NYS Department of Corrections and aggregated by geographic information to create the visual. While race was not an included variable, 48.8% of statewide prisoners at the time were Black and 24.1% were Hispanic (DOCCS 2016). The pie chart below displays where in NYC incarcerated people were indicted and the incarceration rate per 10,000 for each borough. It should be noted that the county of indictment is not necessarily the county in which a prisoner lived prior to incarceration. This may have caused Manhattan to be over-represented. </p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOver the past two decades,  NYS has reduced the prison population by 30% while crime rate fell faster than the national average (Brennan 2016, 5). This is in part due to altering harsh sentences for drug crimes and lowering minimum sentence requirements. However there are still deep seated issues with incarceration in the state. Potential patterns that were expected were younger inmates being located closer to the city or the proportion of violent crimes to increase with distance. However there are no discernable patterns revealed by sorting the counties by age or severity of crime. A poignant example noted when aggregating the original table was a 21 year old from the Bronx who was located to one of the northernmost facilities for possession of stolen property.</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNationwide recidivism rates, or return to prison following release, show that more than half of incarcerated people return to prison within three years of release (Brennan 2016, 5). The number one cause for reducing recidivism is the ability to maintain support networks, ideally through numerous face-to-face visits (MDOC 2011). Since the majority of people in the system come from poor backgrounds, frequent visits are often an impossibility for those on the outside.</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe allocation process is complicated in numerous ways that are beyond the scope of this report, including overcrowding and internal conflict. The geography of NYS further contributes to these complications, with the main hub in the southeastern corner approximately a six hour drive from both northern and western facilities.  The failure of the system to provide suitable conditions for support networks to be maintained throughout a convicted person’s sentence is indicative of the prevailing focus of the prison system on punishment rather than safety or justice.</p> -->
